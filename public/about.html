<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hy there, my name is Tibor and I'm junior SEO specialist. I'm working about a year now for one SEO agency located in Novi Sad, Serbia.
  I started with a Front-end developer course a few monthes before I started working as the SEO specialist.

<p>Now, I'm continuing with my studies of web development and I like it very much.</p>

<p>I hope it will end well as God commands.</p>
